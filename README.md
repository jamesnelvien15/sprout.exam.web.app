If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think is the next improvement that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or an architectural design.

My top priority for improvement as we deploy this payroll system to production would be to utilize Azure Key Vault for securely storing the connection string, enhancing the system's security and safeguarding sensitive data effectively.

The next improvement I would prioritize as we deploy this payroll system to production is to incorporate "createdon," "createdby," "lastmodifiedby," and "lastmodifiedon" columns in the database design. This enhancement will significantly boost traceability for transactions, allowing us to track when and by whom changes were made, thereby enhancing accountability and audit capabilities.
